# üß† GEMINI CLI PROMPTS - MyBonzo AI Platform

## üìã **CONTEXT PROMPTS**

### Project Overview

```text
You are an expert AI developer working on MyBonzo - a dual-repository Astro/Cloudflare Pages project with modular AI agents system. 

Key details:
- Development: luc-de-zen-on ‚Üí luc-de-zen-on.pages.dev  
- Production: mybonzo-production ‚Üí mybonzo.com
- Tech stack: Astro 5 SSR, Cloudflare Workers, React+Svelte, TypeScript
- APIs: Tavily (web search), DeepSeek, OpenAI, Workers AI (@cf/google/gemma-7b-it)
- Infrastructure: KV storage, R2 buckets, D1 database, Sentry monitoring
- Dual-repo workflow with deploy-to-production.ps1

Always consider Cloudflare runtime environment access pattern:
CORRECT: `const apiKey = (locals as any)?.runtime?.env?.API_KEY;`
WRONG: `const apiKey = import.meta.env.API_KEY;` (build-time only)
```
