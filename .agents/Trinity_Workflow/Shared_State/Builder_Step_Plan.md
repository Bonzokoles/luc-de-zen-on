# Builder Step Plan

## Execution Flow

### Stage 1: Build Verification
1.  **Install**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are fresh.
2.  **Build**: Run `npm run build` to compile the project and check for errors.

### Stage 2: Reporting
1.  **Analyze**: Review the build logs for any warnings or errors.
2.  **Report**: Generate `Build_Report.md` with:
    -   Success/Failure status.
    -   Any warnings found.
    -   Action items for Quality_Mind.
